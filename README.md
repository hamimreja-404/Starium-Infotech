# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

IT Services Page
This is a modern, responsive React component that showcases a company's core IT services. Built with React and Vite, it features a clean design, smooth animations, and includes a toggle for light and dark modes to enhance user experience.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Features
Responsive Design: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

* Dark/Light Mode: Users can switch between a dark and a light theme for comfortable viewing in any lighting condition.

* Scroll Animations: Service cards gracefully fade and slide into view as the user scrolls down the page.

* Component-Based: The project is built with reusable React components, making it easy to manage and extend.

* Iconography: Uses lucide-react for clean and modern icons that enhance visual communication.

* Tailwind CSS: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a utility-first and highly customizable design.

# File Structure
The project is organized into several key components for clarity and maintainability:

* App.jsx: The main entry point of the application. It simply renders the ServicePage component.

* Services_page.jsx: This is the core component for the services page. It manages the theme state (light/dark) and dynamically renders the list of ServiceCard components based on the data provided.

* ServiceCard.jsx: A reusable component responsible for displaying a single service. It includes:

* ServicesData.jsx: This file contains the data for all the services. It exports an array of objects, where each object represents a service with its title, description, icon, and other details. This separation of data from the UI makes it easy to update service information without touching the component logic.
